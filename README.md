**Twitmap**

To see what's being tweeted and where, go to the home page (index.jsp) and select a hashtag from the dropdown menu; click the Twitmap icon on the right and see the 300 most recent tweets containing your selected hashtag plotted on a map of the world!


**Developer Notes**

If the app is deployed on Tomcat, it might be necessary to increase the timeout for the server as the app takes a while to deploy. 

As the tweets are polled when the user clicks the Twitmap button, a bit of patience is required (up to ~20 secs give or take) to see the tweets on the map.
